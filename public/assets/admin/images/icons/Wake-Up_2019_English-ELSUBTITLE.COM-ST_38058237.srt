1
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,432
Julia.

2
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,098
Julia, where are you?

3
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,385
Can you hear me?

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,187
What's going on? Julia!

5
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,224
Please, answer me.

6
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,108
I just need to hear your voice.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,645
Julia, please.

8
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,113
Please, come home.

9
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,285
Please?

10
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,360
Has now been identified
as local woman, Julian Govern.

11
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,325
No comment from the family
who asked for privacy

12
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,240
as the investigation continues.

13
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,339
Come on, I know you're in there.

14
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,547
Wake up.

15
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,017
A moment of your time, sir.

16
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,073
What can I do for you, mister?
You selling something?

17
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,642
I got something I think you
might like.

18
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,644
It's for those times
when Viagra's not working.

19
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,283
I'm not interested. Beat it.

20
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,377
Hey, it's a supplement,
everyone's using it.

21
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,463
Yeah? What is it? What's it
caHed?

22
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,709
It's called "Grow-some-balls."

23
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,656
it might even help you lose some
weight, you fat fuck.

24
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,090
Ah, Frank.

25
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,846
Still flapping your jaws.

26
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,348
Hey, F ran k.

27
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,638
Goddamn, son. You got old.

28
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,540
I'll always be younger
than you, though.

29
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,395
Yeah, well, gravity does suck.

30
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,633
You don't have
to do that any more.

31
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,487
Karen's been gone a long time
now.

32
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,613
Oh, right.

33
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,191
Oh, my, yeah. She would smack me
at the back of the head.

34
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,485
Oh, yes, she would.

35
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,328
Hey, uh, pardon our appearance,
we are in transition.

36
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,536
We had to fire our decorator.

37
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,916
Yeah?

38
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,895
Well, it still looks like a
piece of shit.

39
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,170
Hey.
And you're the same old asshole.

40
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,672
- Yeah.
- 0liver!

41
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,463
Somebody down here wants to see
you.

42
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,636
Whoa!

43
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,801
Fuck me, Roger.

44
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,259
It looks like you had a grown
man that ate your little kid.

45
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,086
It's good to see you, Uncle Frank.

46
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,128
- Wow! Good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah.

47
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,517
Still playing ball, I see?

48
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,436
Yep, what else is there.

49
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,945
Uh. Well, nothing, obviously.

50
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,777
No call from the Bigs yet?

51
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,826
Screw you.

52
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,483
You know what? 
I can arrest you.

53
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,183
I could arrest you
for being disrespectful.

54
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,607
No disrespect was intended.

55
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm gonna arrest you for
being an ugly son of a bitch.

56
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,482
Yeah, yeah, well, you do that.

57
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,626
In the meantime, tell your kids
to add me on Snapchat.

58
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,438
- It's good to see you!
- You, too.

59
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,010
So let me ask you a question,
Frank.

60
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,598
You here to reminisce,
talk old war stories or what?

61
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,895
No.

62
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,390
I'm here to work.

63
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,687
First one is Linda Gorecki.

64
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,772
She was, uh...

65
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,687
raped, strangled and tortured...

66
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,573
from Skokie about a year ago.

67
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,367
Next is, uh, Eileen Lane.

68
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,705
She was found just outside of
Dallas.

69
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
Over the border.

70
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,540
Remember this one?

71
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,209
Yeah, that's Julia Govern.

72
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,624
Found her in that old patch of
woods

73
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,542
over by Highway 77.

74
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,222
And so all these women were
found with this marigold crown,

75
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,267
they were all raped,

76
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,884
tortured and strangled.

77
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,729
All...

78
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,976
blonde, around the same age,
early 30's.

79
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,232
Found in the woods
with a cellphone in the hand.

80
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,393
Final call, to their mothers.

81
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,528
So why here, why now, Frank?

82
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,054
Well, we got a missing person
form a couple towns over, Annabelle Fargo.

83
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,318
She fits the exact description.

84
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,849
And her parents says
she came over here to...

85
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,579
visit a friend, and fell off
the map.

86
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,536
I need more eyes on this, Roger.

87
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,792
All right, buddy.
Anything I could do to help.

88
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,828
I'll put my best guys on it.

89
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,132
Hmm.

90
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,010
You got to be shittin' me.

91
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,055
No judgment.

92
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,118
What you think of me
is none of my damn business.

93
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,599
- Cheers.
- No, that's bad luck.

94
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,763
Hey.

95
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,661
It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

96
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,016
It's all right, it's all right.

97
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,661
Calm... calm down. It's okay.

98
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,088
It's okay, look at me.

99
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,501
It's all right,
Do you remember what happened?

100
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,605
- No.
- No, okay.

101
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,851
You're in the ho... It's okay.

102
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,965
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. You're safe.

103
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,389
You're safe. You're in the hospital.
You're in Oklahoma City.

104
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,834
But don't worry, It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna take good care of you.

105
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,491
It's okay. Can you calm
down so I can go get a doctor?

106
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,398
Hey, man.

107
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,587
My guys found something
you should see.

108
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,671
- What?
- I'm heading there now.

109
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,730
All right.

110
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,645
All right, text me the address.

111
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,485
I got to get some caffeine in me.

112
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,775
Fuck the caffeine.
Be on your horse, pronto.

113
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,617
Fucking rude awakening.

114
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,738
Any luck?

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,946
Well, we have to run some tests.

116
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,940
Could it be retrograde amnesia?

117
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,278
Looks that way.

118
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,864
Anyone come through to claim
him?

119
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,948
No. No missing persons reports.
I did call the station.

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,117
Nurse by day.
Sherlock Holmes by night.

121
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,832
Well, I'm a nurse by day
and by night, doctor.

122
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,918
The bandages should be
coming off in a few days.

123
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,084
And we can blast out his photo.

124
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,137
All right, well...

125
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,491
for now, I'll just keep him
talking

126
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,676
- and hopefully...
- Uh, Diana,

127
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,425
your shift ended hours ago.

128
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,935
When was the last time
you had some decent sleep?

129
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,971
Go home, try it.

130
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,723
Doctor's orders.

131
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,297
Doctor Herman, have you
ever had a patient like him before?

132
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,936
Personally, no.

133
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,197
But if it really is retrograde
amnesia,

134
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,451
well, the odds of him recovering
his memories are very slim.

135
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,496
Thanks.

136
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,215
Hi.

137
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,940
- Where'd you learn how to do that?
- I wasn't aware I was doing it.

138
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,224
Here.

139
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,892
It's you rs.

140
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,016
It's quite something.

141
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,856
It's got to be a clue, right?

142
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,982
It's got to mean something?

143
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,111
Nope.

144
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,055
The doctor says you're
gonna make a full recovery.

145
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,239
There's a really good chance.

146
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,073
Well, don't try to remember it
all at once.

147
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,706
Baby steps, John.

148
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,709
That's not my name.

149
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,887
- Sir, do you see the tape?
- FBI. FBI.

150
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,576
- He's all right.
- Oh, sorry.

151
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,146
What do we got?

152
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,460
Well, I'm surprised they let you
in, looking like that.

153
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,145
'Cause I got a bigger badge
than you.

154
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,981
Bigger ego, too. What, you got
no sleep?

155
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,736
Well, thanks to you. What do we
got?

156
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,385
- This better be good.
- What's not good?

157
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,239
We ran the license plate.

158
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,196
The car belongs to the girl.

159
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,201
Annabelle Fargo.

160
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,121
You got to be shittin' me.

161
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,872
Was she driving?

162
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,877
No.

163
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,038
She was in the trunk.

164
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,755
Shit.

165
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,012
We found one guy
that could be a lead.

166
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,023
He was checked in to McNabb
Hospital a few days back.

167
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,274
Nasty car accident.

168
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,152
Goddamn mess.

169
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,912
We should be able to get those
off today.

170
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,956
Now, we got to do this.

171
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,954
I wonder if I was afraid
of needles before,

172
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,047
'cause I sure as shit am now.

173
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,448
- Well, you've been through much worse.
- I told you! He's not ready!

174
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,336
- FBI. I need a word with your patient.
- Uh...

175
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,389
Excuse me!

176
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,099
Julia Govern,

177
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,287
Eileen Lane, Annabelle Fargo,

178
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,393
any of those names ring a bell?

179
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,848
- No, sir.
- No?

180
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,182
Annabelle Fargo was found
stuffed in a trunk...

181
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,069
of her car that you were
driving.

182
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,313
It's got your blood all over it.

183
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,240
- Oh, my god.
- What the fuck is going on?

184
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,200
- Get out of here.
- Move it, move it!

185
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,285
- Get the hell out of here!
- Hold him, Diana!

186
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,176
Can you hear me?

187
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,021
Can you hear me?

188
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,402
I didn't do nothing.

189
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,289
They're outside...

190
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,829
waiting for you to wake up.

191
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,370
They wanna ask you some
questions.

192
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,080
I don't know how they expect me
to give any answers.

193
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,582
Diana,
can I see you in the hall for a second?

194
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,227
He'll be back with more
questions in the morning.

195
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,277
Dr. Herman.

196
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,029
Thank you for keeping
that dead motherfucker alive.

197
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,198
There's a cop standing guard
tonight.

198
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,284
I need you to go home now.

199
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,016
- But what if something happens? What if...
- This is not up for discussion.

200
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,400
We don't know what he's capable
of.

201
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,333
I want you to get your things
and go home. Now!

202
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,519
Hi, you reached Sheriff Bower.

203
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,459
Please leave your name and number
and the reason you're calling.

204
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,843
- Be a good boy.
- I will.

205
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,171
I'll ge
back to you as soon as I can.

206
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,380
It's me. Frank.

207
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,439
Listen, it's him.

208
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,229
Prints all over the car.

209
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,093
Getthis, the motherfucker
trying to convince folks...

210
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,573
that he's got amnesia.

211
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,499
So there's that.
All right, give me a call back.

212
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,516
You have one new message.

213
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,459
.R' Happy birthday to you I.

214
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,112
Diana! It's your old pal, Tommy.

215
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,171
Hey, do me a favor,
come by and see me soon.

216
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,225
It's been too long.

217
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,218
And happy birthday.

218
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,871
Hope you're having at least a
little fun.

219
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,420
Do something nice for yourself, okay?

220
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,607
How's yo ur sleep?

221
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,352
They're not so good, I remind
you.

222
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,147
Considering what you done.

223
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,154
I didn't do nothing.

224
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,832
"I didn't do nothing."
Yeah, we heard this already.

225
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,502
I don't remember.

226
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,625
So you don't remember?

227
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,201
Yeah, he doesn't remember,
sol guess, that means, free to go.

228
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,476
What's going on?

229
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,460
We're taking you in
to get an X-ray.

230
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,270
To see if your condition
is suitable for...

231
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,569
being taken in to...

232
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,382
So your nurse here is real good
with the play-by-play.

233
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,486
Wow. See that?

234
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,496
Sit down, now.

235
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,343
Good boy.

236
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,463
Good boy.

237
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,432
Come on.

238
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,310
Go on now, come on.

239
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,542
Ready for takeoff?

240
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,337
Papa needs to refuel.

241
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,470
Keep an eye on him.

242
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,350
See you in a second.

243
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,720
You might want
to uncuff him, Officer.

244
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,428
Have you ever put a spoon in a
microwave?

245
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,566
Fuck!

246
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,404
You got a problem?

247
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,731
Fuck!

248
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,351
Steady, keep him steady.

249
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,832
Bank right.

250
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,877
Stop.

251
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,120
Take off your cuffs.

252
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,458
Come on.

253
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,508
Faster!

254
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,594
I need backup.

255
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,337
McNabb County General Hospital.

256
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,717
- You got a car?
- Yeah.

257
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,770
Let's go get your car.

258
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,639
Stay calm,
we're just opening your car.

259
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,434
Okay, get in.

260
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,741
Start the car.

261
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,875
Out of the way!

262
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Damn it!

263
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,423
Oliver!

264
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,387
I'm gonna make some coffee, you
want some?

265
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,559
I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

266
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:08,905
Sheriff Bower.

267
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,825
You're shittin' me.

268
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,656
All right, no problem.
I'll be there in a minute.

269
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,538
Gotta go, son.

270
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,747
What? Already?

271
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,913
Yeah, you know how it is.

272
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,630
I'll catch you for dinner.

273
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,775
What are you gonna do to me?

274
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,440
Just keep going.

275
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,029
- Stop the car.
- Why?

276
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,083
Now!

277
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,091
Fuck!

278
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,109
You're free to go.

279
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,854
Go wherever you want.

280
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,068
What're you gonna do?

281
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,702
I don't know.

282
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,833
You're definitely not a killer.
You don't need that.

283
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,367
What if you just don't
remember doing those things?

284
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,052
I didn't do it.

285
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,883
'Cause I couldn't do it.

286
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,554
What did you say?

287
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,532
Fuck!

288
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,051
Jesus.

289
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,888
I thought you'd still be
sleeping.

290
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,268
Who are you?

291
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,885
Thomas. Thomas Keller.

292
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,189
No.

293
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,316
Who are you?

294
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,687
0h, uh, I'm Diana's friend.

295
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,731
We went to school together,
so it's been a while.

296
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,112
This is my house.

297
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,201
Where is she?

298
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,073
She'll be back soon.

299
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,687
Hi, guys.

300
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,090
I see you're getting acquainted.

301
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,149
Sure.

302
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,940
Breakfast is served.

303
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,998
Thank you.

304
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,209
Thank you.

305
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,140
Who we are looking for?

306
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,766
White male, about 5'9",

307
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,223
slight build, about 37 years
old.

308
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,483
Any defining features?

309
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,941
He's wearing a long sleeved
white shirt,

310
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,855
blue, uh, pajama pants,

311
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,364
brown suede slippers.

312
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,742
His face is covered in bandages.

313
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,868
He also has very deep, blue
eyes.

314
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,217
It might be your type,
but that's not my type.

315
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,771
All I wanna do is hunt this guy
down.

316
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,795
Appreciate your help.

317
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,838
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,236
They printed your name and
everything.

319
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,083
You're either a kidnap victim
or an accessory to murder.

320
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,090
That's so stupid.

321
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,763
You neverjust show up here,

322
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,038
and with some old friend,
you say, needs time to heal.

323
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,062
I'm sorry.

324
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,001
I'm the only friend you've
ever had and kept, Diana.

325
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,305
I'm sorry I lied to you.

326
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,145
I didn't want to get you
involved.

327
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,401
Well... that didn't work!

328
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,447
I'm very much involved!

329
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,028
There's a serial killer
sleeping in my bed!

330
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,825
He didn't do it.

331
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,035
How do you know that?

332
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,494
You know, you look an awful lot
like his other victims.

333
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,873
Yeah, well,
he had the opportunity to kill me.

334
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,522
We were in the woods alone,
and he had a gun, and he didn't do it.

335
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,969
Diana.

336
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,257
Is this about your dad?

337
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,968
Oh, Jesus Christ, don't worry.

338
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,224
Listen, Diana, I know that it
hurts.

339
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,678
You have to forgive yourself.

340
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,437
You have to hand him into the
police.

341
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,683
No. I have to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

342
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,361
Diana.

343
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,323
I love you. I'll do whatever I need
to do to help you get through this.

344
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,199
You can stay here as long as
you need.

345
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,995
Okay? Just...

346
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,820
without him.

347
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,043
He didn't do it.

348
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,334
- How do you know that?
- This is a mistake.

349
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,335
Hey, hey.

350
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,587
Diana.

351
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,792
Di...

352
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,880
Hey, where are you going?

353
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,841
Go back to your friend.

354
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,302
No. I wanna help you.

355
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,189
What do you suggest?

356
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
I go to the police,

357
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,235
or they'll help me...

358
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,890
all the way to a lethal
injection?

359
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,521
We need to gather evidence

360
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,905
to prove your own case.

361
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,138
If you're innocent,
you'll be able to prove it.

362
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,162
And what if I'm not?

363
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,081
Hm?

364
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,492
Well, if you're not,
then lethal injection ain't enough.

365
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,753
Right.

366
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,577
Hey, I'm going with you!

367
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,083
So far, you've been a hostage.

368
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,253
You take one more step,
you're an accomplice.

369
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,182
Life without parole.

370
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,283
Well, let's just hope I'm right
about you.

371
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,494
You know how to drive a truck?

372
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,539
It can't be too hard.

373
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,453
I think Diana should drive.

374
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,171
All right.

375
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,215
Thank you...

376
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,092
for this and everything.

377
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,801
Diana.

378
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,126
You always said I should move
on.

379
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,966
Let me.

380
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,529
Hey.

381
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,490
Thank you.

382
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,119
She's too good for this.

383
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,502
I know.

384
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,379
I know.

385
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,095
All right, let's go.

386
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,138
So, where to first?

387
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,094
Last crime scene.

388
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:23,679
If I see it, it might trigger
something.

389
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,646
Where is it?

390
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,314
I don't remember.

391
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,567
Right.

392
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,402
Nice try.

393
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,527
I don't know why I did that.

394
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,487
Whoa. What do you need?

395
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,492
Um, there should be a map in
there.

396
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,581
Map?

397
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,615
Did I wake up in the past?

398
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,287
Well, I'm sure
I can't use my phone.

399
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,625
They're probably tracking it.

400
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,675
All right.

401
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,471
Oh, god.

402
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,764
What?

403
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,346
Oh, my god. There's...

404
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,727
What do we do?

405
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,104
Well, we can't turn back now.

406
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,525
Just stay calm.

407
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,591
I don't think I breathed at all.

408
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,461
Thank god we took the truck.

409
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,095
They must be searching for my
car.

410
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,760
All right.
It should be around here somewhere.

411
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,713
Hey.

412
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,590
Let me go alone.

413
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,631
Just in case.

414
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,650
You promised.

415
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,554
Let's go.

416
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,888
What is it?

417
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,682
I knew her.

418
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,011
Let's go.

419
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,565
What are you doing?

420
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,769
Julia Govern lived in McNabb.

421
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:05,903
So?

422
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
So it might be more useful
going there

423
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,653
than just driving up
the next patch of trees.

424
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,699
Right.

425
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,721
I don't want to go in there.

426
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,524
What if her mother recognizes
me?

427
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,736
All right. Well, I'll just go
in.

428
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,616
Some information I can get.

429
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,784
What's going on?

430
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,974
What happened?

431
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,512
I just got a sharp pain in my...

432
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,811
in my stomach.

433
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,146
I just...

434
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,978
I think I need to lie down.

435
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,344
All right. Let's get you to a motel.

436
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,082
Thank you, sir.

437
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,032
We won't be long, buddy.

438
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,542
Oh, it's a nice place.
Not what I expected.

439
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,543
It's right up the alley.

440
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,800
Yeah, maybe she'll, uh,

441
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,552
she'll sell it to you...

442
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,637
to make her bail money.

443
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,015
Pretty bad taste, though, buddy.

444
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,559
I mean, for all we know,

445
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,687
this girl is lying in a field
somewhere, dead.

446
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,691
I don't know. I'm just...

447
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,443
Of course, she's dead, you know.

448
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,169
Well, maybe she's in cahoots
with this guy.

449
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,271
That doesn't sound right.

450
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,872
Wait a minute.

451
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,739
I think we might have something.

452
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:57,801
Hmm.

453
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,717
Let's get an ID on this guy.

454
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,724
That's right. Might just take
it.

455
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,193
How is this?

456
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,946
You really should get some rest.

457
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,616
Will do.

458
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,957
Okay.

459
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,202
I'll be right back.
Right after I check out Julia's.

460
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,333
Are you sure you're gonna be
okay?

461
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,183
Do n't wo rry.

462
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,298
You. I think I know you.

463
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:34,976
I know you, don't I?

464
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,020
What the fuck?

465
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,271
Who are you?

466
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:39,557
Get the fuck out of here!

467
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,316
Hey, stop!

468
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,029
Who are you?

469
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,114
Who am I?

470
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,316
Shit!

471
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,819
Fuck!

472
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,912
Jesus. Fuck!

473
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,838
911.

474
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,343
What is your emergency?

475
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,769
Hello?

476
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,436
What is your emergency?

477
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,405
Is your mother home?

478
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,429
Why?

479
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:54,825
I was just hoping
I can get a word with her.

480
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,889
You gonna ask about Julia?

481
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,308
Mia!

482
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,081
What have I told you about
opening the door for strangers?

483
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,105
Mia, go to your room.

484
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,327
I'm sorry
to intrude like this. I...

485
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,315
Who are you? What do you want?

486
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,361
I'm a journalist.

487
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,097
I don't talk to journalists
anymore.

488
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,510
Well, it's about
another young woman.

489
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,803
- No.
- She's missing,

490
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,107
and it's just like your
daughter.

491
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,165
Any information you have
could save a life.

492
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,411
I know that this is probably
really hard for you to talk about.

493
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,211
You don't know.

494
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,298
There's just heartbreak, and
hurt, and...

495
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,379
and unanswered questions.

496
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,963
There must be something that...
No.

497
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,642
I'd...

498
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,173
I'd hoped that it would be
solved.

499
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,524
What do you mean "cruel joke"?

500
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,153
Everything you need to know
is in the cemetery.

501
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,065
And all the good ones are there.

502
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,444
If you're good, just stop
looking.

503
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:04,161
You know, stop digging your own grave
or you'll all end up out there, too.

504
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,253
Criminal clear?

505
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,299
Yes, sir.

506
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,131
What happened here? Are you all
right?

507
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,184
I'm fine.

508
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,144
Can I get a minute alone with
my dad?

509
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,196
What happened?

510
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,576
He was here.

511
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,327
Who was here?

512
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,454
He was here.

513
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:25,915
The killer.

514
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,668
What?

515
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,077
Are you sure?

516
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,327
Anything?

517
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,245
No.

518
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,199
I don't know.

519
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,311
She said that I could find
all the answers in the cemetery.

520
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,335
What does that mean?

521
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,455
I wish I could tell you.

522
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,330
She's in distress, Diana.

523
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,461
It's okay.

524
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,262
It's okay.

525
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,297
You're still in recovery.
You should really be in bed.

526
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,431
I already got a nap.

527
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,478
Go ahead.

528
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,438
All right.

529
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,398
Thank you.

530
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,152
Good night, Diana.

531
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,453
Good night, John.

532
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,568
Shot of beer.

533
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,156
What's your name?

534
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,196
Audrey.

535
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,331
Audrey.

536
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,353
I bet you could tell me how to
get to Ridgewood Brook Lane?

537
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,288
Well, maybe.

538
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,455
Just go out to the road.

539
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:42,379
Take a left, then make a right.

540
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,589
And at the stop sign, you'll
get to Brook.

541
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,257
What time you'd get off?

542
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,057
Two-thirty.

543
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:52,729
I'll check back around.

544
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,538
Couldn't sleep?

545
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,513
You?

546
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,681
A little.

547
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,229
Look, I'm no nurse,
but I don't think those are good for you.

548
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,475
Just bummed it off
over a friendly drunk girl.

549
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,317
Guess I needed something
to take the edge off.

550
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,314
I really wish we found
something today.

551
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,535
Yeah.

552
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,489
Diana, I want you to do
something for me.

553
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,620
I want you to go home.

554
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,581
To your job, your life.

555
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,247
- I can't.
- Why?

556
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,275
It's got to be better than this
shithole.

557
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,632
When I was 15 years old, we found
out my daddy was having an affair.

558
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,769
We had no idea until his mistress
turned up dead in her apartment.

559
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,354
He was sentenced to life in
prison,

560
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,355
and I swore to god
I'd never talk to him again.

561
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,660
Four years after that,
he hung himself.

562
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,698
Two years later,

563
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,428
new evidence emerged and they
caught the guy who actually did it.

564
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,268
So he died thinking I wanted him
dead, and that's probably why.

565
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,606
What else could you have done?

566
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,372
I could have believed him.

567
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,871
He said the same thing you did.

568
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,952
"I didn't do it 'cause I
couldn't."

569
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:48,838
That was his only defense.

570
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,304
I won't let that happen to you.

571
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,906
You should go and let him know
we're here.

572
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,626
I'll put this in the garage for
him.

573
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,511
Tom's very particular about his
stuff.

574
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:42,899
I noticed.

575
00:56:58,874 --> 00:56:59,874
Thomas?

576
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,455
Tom?

577
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:44,961
Thomas?

578
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,845
Thomas?

579
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,671
I'm sorry, Thomas.

580
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,602
Thomas?

581
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:04,981
Thomas?

582
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,475
Oh, shit!

583
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,906
Fuck!

584
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,612
What did you do?

585
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,665
Jesus!

586
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:24,956
Diana, I didn't do this.

587
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,002
You killed Tom?

588
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,584
I couldn't kill Tom!

589
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,982
Don't say that to me.

590
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,462
Diana, listen to me.

591
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:32,959
You knew what my dad said
and you used it against me.

592
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,010
No.

593
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,636
No, Diana...

594
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,013
Diana!

595
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,607
Who the fuck are you?

596
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:00,905
Who are you?

597
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,877
Look what I found.

598
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:56,884
Shit.

599
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,322
So you think that sweet, little
nurse...

600
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,426
killed both her best friend

601
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:01,847
and our John Doe?

602
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,120
I tell you right now,
that son of a bitch is not our John Doe.

603
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,554
How could you be so sure?

604
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,706
I got a good look at his face.

605
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,730
I know him.

606
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,851
His name is Mark Rosovski.

607
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,060
He was doing time over in
Yankton.

608
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,895
He got parole about a month ago.

609
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,072
What was he in for?

610
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,699
Attempted murder for hire.

611
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,390
Looks to me like we're not the
only ones trying to find this guy.

612
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,741
This whole damn thing, it's starting
to spiral out of control, Frank.

613
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,918
God only knows what we're
gonna end up with this.

614
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,706
Fuckin' mess.

615
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,046
Fuck. Fuck.

616
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:54,055
Folks, if you see or hear anything
possibly related to this crime,

617
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,062
I want you to contact
local authorities immediately.

618
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,126
- 'Cause I'm still looking for...
- The assailant is supposed

619
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,190
to be armed and dangerous.

620
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,475
Now, I'm asking you to please..

621
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,353
Help us find this killer
before he claims another victim.

622
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,009
We need all
the help we can get, please.

623
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,500
Fulton County Sheriff office.
What's your emergency?

624
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,879
I'd like to speak to Sheriff
Roger Bower.

625
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,082
Uh, one moment, please.

626
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:27,386
Who is it?

627
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,429
Hello?

628
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,159
I have information on the serial
killer y'all are looking for.

629
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,183
Diana, is this you?

630
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,557
Stay where you are.

631
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,540
I'm coming for you.

632
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,929
Don't you fucking move. Don't...

633
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,482
Hello...

634
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,022
Fuck.

635
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,179
[rips} - Hey!

636
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,264
Oh, don't act like you give a
shit.

637
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,092
Hi.

638
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,593
Hi.

639
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,214
Is Roger Bower home?

640
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,764
Uh, no. You can find him at the
station.

641
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:40,266
I was just hoping I could catch him
alone, away from all that.

642
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,390
Well, do you wanna wait for him?

643
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,225
Sure.

644
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,018
I'd love to. Thank you.

645
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,318
I'm Diana.

646
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,231
I'm Oliver. Roger's son.

647
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,323
Thanks.

648
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,392
Oh, I'm sorry about the mess.
We're...

649
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,029
We're redoing a lot.

650
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,082
Oh, it's fine.

651
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,421
Here.

652
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,499
- Thank you.
- Sure.

653
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,952
I hope I'm not intruding.

654
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,483
Nah. It's nice to have
a visitor.

655
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,247
I'm supposed to lay low anyway.

656
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:35,551
Doctor's orders.

657
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,462
I'd have to agree with him.

658
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,385
But anyway, I'm a nurse.

659
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,386
What happened?

660
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,139
If I may ask.

661
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,352
Home intruder.

662
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,143
If you can believe it.

663
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,223
Same guy who's on the run
for murdering all those women.

664
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,527
Did you hear about it on the
news, or...

665
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,532
Yeah, I did.

666
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,242
I know him, actually.

667
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,281
I actually believed he was
innocent, so...

668
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,583
Can I get you a drink?

669
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,437
My dad makes this lemonade,
it's famous in McNabb.

670
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:11,461
Sure.

671
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,509
- He can't go that so far, right?
- Frank.

672
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,267
Diana.

673
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,436
It's me.

674
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,263
Well, I'll be damned.

675
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,283
My name is
Detective Michael Winslow.

676
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,144
If you need any more
information,

677
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,656
ask Roger Bower.

678
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,281
You got a location on that call?

679
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,612
He used a burner phone, sir.

680
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,840
Thank you.

681
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,513
That is nice.

682
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,756
Secret family recipe.

683
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,684
I have to say, you look a lot
like my mother.

684
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,438
Really?

685
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,648
Let me show you.

686
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,403
Oh, she is beautiful.

687
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:08,412
She, uh...

688
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,283
was very beautiful.

689
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,290
When she was alive.

690
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:15,745
I'm sorry to hear that.

691
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:23,552
Roger.

692
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,471
Roger!

693
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,973
- Ro... Have you seen Sheriff?
- No, sir.

694
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,392
- Have you seen the sheriff?
- No.

695
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,321
Sheriff Bower here.

696
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,371
Roger.

697
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,746
I just got a really fucked up
phone call.

698
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,377
What is it?

699
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,453
Do you know a guy named Michael
Winslow?

700
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,592
Roger?

701
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,479
Get out of here. Leave me alone!

702
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,394
I'm Michael Winslow, right?

703
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,426
- What do you want from me?
- Right?

704
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,450
Tell me!

705
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,539
Tell me.

706
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,409
I'm trying to remember.

707
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:38,748
What else do you remember?

708
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,978
The hell you put me and my
father through?

709
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,751
- What did I do?
- You were crazy.

710
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,986
Saying and doing things you
didn't mean.

711
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,710
You were like a brother to me,
and then...

712
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,681
And then what?

713
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,172
You're obsessed with those
girls.

714
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,374
No matter how many times we
told you to.

715
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,504
Oliver.

716
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,620
So now you remember.

717
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:28,757
Oh, Mikey.

718
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:30,554
Mikey.

719
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:34,516
Mikey.

720
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,846
There he is.

721
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,260
Thought you'd never wake up.

722
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,824
What did you do to her?

723
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,449
She just passed out. Don't
worry.

724
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,330
I saved the good stuff for you
to watch.

725
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,914
You really like this one, huh?

726
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:04,963
Me, too.

727
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,577
I generally prefer blondes,
but...

728
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,335
That's just my type.

729
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,672
Does she look like your mama?

730
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,000
Like all your other victims?

731
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,476
You don't remember
what my mother looks like.

732
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:25,810
My own best friend.

733
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,521
I was never your friend.

734
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,570
Wow!

735
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,079
And I thought you were lying
about the amnesia.

736
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,762
I guess the upside
to my mother being dead

737
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,368
is that she'll always be young
and beautiful to me.

738
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,050
Why do you feel the need
to kill young women?

739
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,494
I felt awful when I hit
Linda Goreki with my car.

740
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,459
But the funny thing is...

741
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,643
all I could think about was what a
mother would say when she found out.

742
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,097
So I called her,

743
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:58,058
from Linda's phone.

744
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,884
I was too scared to say
anything, so I...

745
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,429
I just listened.

746
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,557
It was nice to hear
a mother's voice again.

747
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,518
You're sick, Oliver.

748
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,729
You killed five young women.

749
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,740
Right, well...

750
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,290
almost six.

751
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,706
See, I know I'm sick, John.

752
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,704
That's just who I am now.

753
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:28,999
I can't change it.

754
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,875
I've tried to.

755
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,798
And I can't, so...

756
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:35,971
Diana.

757
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,722
It's okay.

758
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,975
Shh.

759
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,892
Don't lie to her before she dies.

760
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,471
Dianal

761
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,231
Oliver!

762
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,598
Stay back.

763
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,687
Okay.

764
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,729
- I need you to dial 911.
- All right.

765
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,023
- Dial.
- I got it.

766
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,740
Then leave the house.

767
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:38,193
Don't come back no matter what
you hear.

768
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:39,826
Go.

769
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,061
You're a good detective.

770
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,728
Damn good one.

771
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,151
He was sick...

772
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,609
after his mama died.

773
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,073
Five girls, Roger.

774
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,623
Five.

775
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:47,947
I swear to god, Roger.

776
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,746
I'm gonna find this bastard.

777
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,038
You got to know, it killed me.

778
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,123
When he was doing it.

779
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,001
It tore me up inside.

780
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:08,055
I vowed that I would protect
that boy no matter what.

781
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:14,144
I just had no idea how far
I would have to take it.

782
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,341
I knew you were gonna find him.

783
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,237
My son.

784
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,734
The only family I have left
was gonna be taken away from me.

785
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:30,994
It was either you or him.

786
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:56,978
Oliver!

787
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,230
Wait!

788
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,022
Damn it.

789
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,077
Roger.

790
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,074
I've located Annabelle Fargo.

791
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,323
In a trunk of a car.

792
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,634
I'm calling you first
'cause you're my friend.

793
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:59,533
But I've got to call it in.

794
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,292
Look, Mike. No, please.

795
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,252
Not yet.

796
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,332
Look, I just got a call with
Oliver.

797
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,446
He's gonna meet me over
at Lou's Ranch at the warehouse.

798
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,301
I wanna be there when he's
arrested.

799
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,924
Please, we'll take him in together.
I promise, please.

800
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,267
Hero cop...

801
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,769
found the killer.

802
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,278
And I was a good dad.

803
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,942
I tried to take care of it.

804
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,311
Jesus Christ. What have you
done?

805
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,191
What the fuck is wrong with you?

806
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,071
Dad, please.

807
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,364
I blacked out.

808
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:13,606
I couldn't help myself.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

809
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,038
Dad.

810
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,829
And Mike.

811
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,211
Mikey saw me.

812
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:28,174
He knows!

813
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:32,583
They're gonna kill me!

814
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,424
They're gonna put me down. I...

815
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,141
I felt like I
didn't have a choice.

816
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,432
It was so damn hard for me,
Michael.

817
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,181
You were like a son to me.

818
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,104
But Oliver...

819
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,317
he was my son.

820
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,407
When you called me,

821
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,121
I sent Rosovski instead.

822
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,416
I told him where you were going.

823
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:07,902
And hired him to handle the
situation.

824
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,269
The son of a bitch
were sure that you were dead.

825
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,508
He took your badge and ID
like I told him to.

826
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:34,532
And that was that.

827
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,525
But you must have some kind
of guardian angel

828
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,979
looking out for you, because
well...

829
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,205
here you are.

830
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,489
When I heard that you were stil
out there, still kicking,

831
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:45,911
[sent him to finish the job.

832
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,245
I knew that if you were alive,

833
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,038
it was just a matter of time
before you caught him again.

834
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:55,925
Who died in my house?

835
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,092
How'd you fake my death?

836
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:07,938
I took the body of some sorry
John Doe from the morgue.

837
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,309
And then I planned the gas
explosion.

838
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:15,504
Then I swapped his fingerprints
for yours.

839
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:19,449
He became Michael Winslow, and
you...

840
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,452
I thought it was a good thing.

841
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:33,001
Maybe this whole thing could
finally end for my family.

842
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,218
Making you...

843
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,376
seem like a killer.

844
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,176
And it wasn't a bad idea
somehow.

845
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,010
And now my boy is dead.

846
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,982
Oh, god, help me. I killed my
boy.

847
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,150
And all I can think about...

848
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,570
is that I should've done it a
lot sooner.

849
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,995
You remember...

850
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,118
I taught you how to make this.

851
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,512
Right before you tried to kill
me.

852
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,265
It killed me, too, Mike.

853
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,184
I want you to say my name, RogeL.

854
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,398
The whole thing.

855
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,227
So I can be sure.

856
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,485
Detective Michael Winslow.

857
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,405
You know, they'll be coming
soon.

858
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,330
Yeah.

859
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,983
You go on. You tell them
everything.

860
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,247
Don't worry, I'm not gonna go
anywhere.

861
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,423
I got nowhere left to run to.

862
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,489
Get down
on the ground! Get down!

863
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,616
Down on your knees!

864
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,338
Hold on. Hold up, hold up.

865
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,751
Get him up. Get him up. Get him
up!

866
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:50,455
I talked to Diana.

867
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:51,479
Where's the body?

868
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:52,813
In the basement.

869
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:54,482
Where's Roger?

870
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,099
Fuck.
